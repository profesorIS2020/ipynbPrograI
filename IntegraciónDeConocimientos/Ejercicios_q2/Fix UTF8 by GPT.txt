Excellent question.

Even though **your source files are saved in UTF-8**, the **console (terminal) or environment where you run the program may not support or show UTF-8 characters correctly**, especially if:

* You're using **Windows CMD or PowerShell**, which defaults to a legacy code page (like CP1252 or CP850).
* You're compiling with `g++` but viewing the output in a terminal that doesn't support UTF-8 rendering.
* The terminal font doesn't support accented characters.

### âœ… Solution Options

#### ðŸ”¹ **1. Force UTF-8 in Windows Terminal (or PowerShell)**

Before running your program, type:

```bash
chcp 65001
```

Then re-run your program:

```bash
.\app
```

This sets the **Windows console to UTF-8** code page (`65001`), so accents like `Ã¡`, `Ã©`, `Ã±`, etc., are rendered correctly.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ **2. Use Windows Terminal / Git Bash / WSL**

* **Windows Terminal** is UTF-8â€“friendly by default.
* **Git Bash** also renders UTF-8 well.
* **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) runs Ubuntu and handles UTF-8 correctly too.

---

#### ðŸ”¹ **3. Print UTF-8 explicitly in C++ (if needed)**

You usually donâ€™t have to do this, but just in case:

```cpp
std::cout << u8"Estudiante PÃ©rez agregado con Ã©xito.\n";
```

The `u8` prefix ensures the string is encoded in UTF-8 explicitly.

---

### âœ… Verify Source Encoding

Make sure all source files are saved with **UTF-8 (without BOM)**:

* In **VS Code**: bottom-right corner â†’ click on encoding â†’ select `UTF-8`.

---

### ðŸ§ª Test

You can test quickly with:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << u8"Â¡Bienvenido, JosÃ© GarcÃ­a!" << std::endl;
}
```

If you see `Jos ` or similar, it means the terminal isnâ€™t configured for UTF-8.

Would you like me to help detect the console you're using and give you exact steps?
